# Optionix Infrastructure Architecture: Financial Standards, Security, and Compliance

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed enhancements to the Optionix infrastructure, focusing on achieving robust financial industry standards, heightened security, and comprehensive compliance. The existing infrastructure, comprising Ansible for configuration management, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Terraform for infrastructure as code, will be analyzed for potential gaps and subsequently augmented to meet the stringent requirements of financial applications. The goal is to create a highly secure, auditable, and resilient infrastructure capable of handling sensitive financial data and transactions.

## 2. Current Infrastructure Overview

### 2.1. Ansible

Ansible is currently used for automating the provisioning and configuration of servers and other infrastructure components. It provides a declarative language for defining system states, which aids in maintaining consistency across environments. The existing Ansible roles include common, database, and webserver configurations.

### 2.2. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is utilized for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. The current Kubernetes setup includes base configurations for application deployments, services, ingress, and persistent storage, with environment-specific overrides for development, staging, and production.

### 2.3. Terraform

Terraform is employed for defining and provisioning infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It manages resources across various cloud providers, ensuring that the infrastructure is consistently deployed and easily reproducible. The existing Terraform modules cover compute, database, network, security, and storage components.

## 3. Financial Industry Standards and Compliance Requirements

Financial institutions operate under strict regulatory frameworks that mandate high levels of security, data privacy, and operational resilience. Key standards and regulations include, but are not limited to:

*   **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):** While Optionix may not directly handle credit card data, the principles of secure network architecture, data protection, vulnerability management, and access control are highly relevant.
*   **SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2):** Focuses on the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. This requires robust controls around data handling, system monitoring, and incident response.
*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** For applications handling personal data of EU citizens, GDPR mandates strict data protection and privacy requirements, including data minimization, consent, and the right to be forgotten.
*   **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Provides a comprehensive framework for managing cybersecurity risk, encompassing identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery.
*   **ISO 27001:** An international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), providing a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure.

## 4. Proposed Infrastructure Enhancements

To meet the aforementioned financial standards and compliance requirements, the following enhancements are proposed across the Ansible, Kubernetes, and Terraform components:

### 4.1. Enhanced Security Measures

#### 4.1.1. Network Security

*   **Micro-segmentation:** Implement granular network policies within Kubernetes to restrict communication between pods to only what is absolutely necessary. This limits the blast radius in case of a breach.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Integrate IDPS solutions at the network perimeter and within the Kubernetes cluster to detect and prevent malicious activities.
*   **DDoS Protection:** Implement robust DDoS mitigation strategies at the network edge.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF for the web-facing components to protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

#### 4.1.2. Data Security

*   **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both at rest (e.g., database, storage volumes) and in transit (e.g., TLS for all inter-service communication, VPN for administrative access).
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement DLP solutions to prevent sensitive financial data from leaving the controlled environment.
*   **Database Security:** Enforce strong authentication, authorization, and auditing for all database access. Implement row-level security where applicable.

#### 4.1.3. Endpoint Security

*   **Vulnerability Management:** Establish a continuous vulnerability scanning and patching process for all servers, containers, and applications.
*   **Antivirus/Anti-malware:** Deploy and maintain up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware solutions on all host systems.

#### 4.1.4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

*   **Least Privilege:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for all users and services, granting only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate MFA for all administrative access to the infrastructure and critical applications.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement comprehensive RBAC across Kubernetes, cloud resources (Terraform), and configuration management (Ansible) to define and enforce access policies.
*   **Centralized Authentication:** Integrate with a centralized identity provider (e.g., LDAP, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) for consistent authentication.

### 4.2. Enhanced Compliance Features

#### 4.2.1. Logging and Monitoring

*   **Centralized Logging:** Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to aggregate logs from all infrastructure components and applications. Logs should be immutable and retained for regulatory-defined periods.
*   **Comprehensive Auditing:** Enable detailed auditing for all administrative actions, data access, and system events. Audit trails should be regularly reviewed and protected from tampering.
*   **Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring for system performance, security events, and compliance deviations. Configure real-time alerts for critical incidents.

#### 4.2.2. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery

*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan to address security breaches and operational disruptions.
*   **Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) Plan:** Implement and test DR/BC plans to ensure continuous operation and rapid recovery in case of major outages. This includes regular backups, geographically dispersed deployments, and automated failover mechanisms.

#### 4.2.3. Configuration Management and Change Control

*   **Version Control:** All infrastructure configurations (Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform code) must be managed under strict version control.
*   **Automated Configuration Drift Detection:** Implement tools to detect and remediate unauthorized changes to configurations.
*   **Change Management Process:** Establish a formal change management process for all infrastructure modifications, including review, approval, and documentation.

#### 4.2.4. Regular Audits and Assessments

*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular internal and external security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.
*   **Compliance Assessments:** Periodically assess compliance with relevant financial regulations and standards.

## 5. Implementation Strategy by Component

### 5.1. Ansible Enhancements

*   **Hardening Playbooks:** Develop and refine playbooks to implement security hardening baselines for all servers, including operating system security, secure shell (SSH) configurations, and firewall rules.
*   **Compliance-focused Roles:** Create new Ansible roles or enhance existing ones to automate the deployment of logging agents, auditing tools, and security monitoring agents.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure Principles:** Where possible, leverage Ansible to build immutable infrastructure components, reducing the risk of configuration drift and simplifying rollbacks.

### 5.2. Kubernetes Enhancements

*   **Network Policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to enforce micro-segmentation between application components.
*   **Pod Security Policies (PSPs) / Pod Security Admission:** Define and enforce PSPs (or the newer Pod Security Admission in Kubernetes 1.25+) to restrict pod capabilities, prevent privilege escalation, and enforce best practices for container security.
*   **Secrets Management:** Utilize Kubernetes Secrets with external secrets management solutions (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for sensitive data, ensuring secrets are not stored directly in manifests.
*   **Image Security:** Implement a container image scanning process in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in container images. Use trusted image registries.
*   **Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges:** Enforce resource quotas and limit ranges to prevent resource exhaustion attacks and ensure fair resource allocation.
*   **Service Mesh:** Consider implementing a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for advanced traffic management, mTLS (mutual TLS) for inter-service communication, and enhanced observability.
*   **Audit Logging:** Configure Kubernetes audit logging to capture detailed records of API server requests, enabling comprehensive security monitoring and forensic analysis.

### 5.3. Terraform Enhancements

*   **Security Group/Network ACL Hardening:** Refine Terraform configurations to create highly restrictive security groups and network ACLs, allowing only necessary inbound and outbound traffic.
*   **Data Encryption Configuration:** Ensure all data storage resources (e.g., S3 buckets, RDS instances, EBS volumes) are provisioned with encryption at rest enabled by default.
*   **IAM Policies:** Define granular IAM policies using Terraform to enforce least privilege for all cloud resources and service accounts.
*   **Logging and Monitoring Integration:** Automate the provisioning and configuration of cloud-native logging and monitoring services (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Stackdriver) to ensure comprehensive audit trails and real-time alerts.
*   **VPC Flow Logs:** Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture detailed network traffic information for security analysis and compliance auditing.
*   **State Management:** Implement secure remote state management (e.g., S3 backend with DynamoDB locking) and state encryption for Terraform to protect sensitive infrastructure configurations.
*   **Policy as Code:** Integrate with policy as code tools (e.g., Open Policy Agent, HashiCorp Sentinel) to enforce security and compliance policies during infrastructure provisioning.
