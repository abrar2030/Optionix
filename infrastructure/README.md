# Infrastructure Directory

## Overview

The `infrastructure` directory contains all the configuration, deployment, and infrastructure-as-code components necessary for deploying and managing the Optionix platform across various environments. This directory houses Docker configurations, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform scripts that enable consistent, repeatable, and automated deployment of the application.

## Components

### Docker

The `Dockerfile` at the root of the infrastructure directory defines the containerization configuration for the Optionix application. This file specifies the base image, dependencies, environment setup, and application code needed to create a containerized version of the application, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

### Ansible

The `ansible` directory contains configuration management and application deployment automation:

- **inventory/**: Defines the target hosts and their groupings for Ansible operations
- **playbooks/**: Contains Ansible playbooks that define sequences of tasks for server configuration and application deployment
- **roles/**: Modular, reusable components of server configuration and application deployment tasks

Ansible is used for consistent server provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment across development, staging, and production environments.

### Kubernetes

The `kubernetes` directory contains manifests for deploying and managing the Optionix application on Kubernetes clusters:

- **base/**: Contains base Kubernetes configurations that are common across all environments
- **deployment.yaml**: Defines how the application should be deployed, including container specifications, replicas, and resource requirements
- **environments/**: Contains environment-specific Kubernetes configurations (likely for development, staging, and production)
- **service.yaml**: Defines how the application is exposed within the Kubernetes cluster and potentially to external users

These Kubernetes manifests enable scalable, resilient, and manageable deployment of the Optionix application in containerized environments.

### Terraform

The `terraform` directory contains infrastructure-as-code configurations for provisioning and managing cloud resources:

- **environments/**: Contains environment-specific Terraform configurations
- **main.tf**: The primary Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources
- **modules/**: Reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure patterns
- **outputs.tf**: Defines the outputs from Terraform execution, such as IP addresses or endpoint URLs
- **variables.tf**: Defines the variables used in the Terraform configurations, allowing for customization

Terraform is used to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure (such as virtual machines, networks, and databases) required by the Optionix application.

## Usage Guidelines

### Local Development with Docker

To build and run the Docker container locally:

```bash
cd infrastructure
docker build -t optionix:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 optionix:latest
```

### Server Provisioning with Ansible

To provision and configure servers:

```bash
cd infrastructure/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/provision.yml
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

To deploy to a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
cd infrastructure/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

### Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

To provision cloud infrastructure:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=environments/production/terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=environments/production/terraform.tfvars
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Separation**: Maintain clear separation between development, staging, and production environments in all infrastructure configurations.

2. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets or credentials to version control. Use appropriate secret management tools for each platform (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, Ansible Vault).

3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Make all infrastructure changes through code rather than manual configuration to ensure consistency and repeatability.

4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Prefer replacing infrastructure components over modifying them in place, especially in production environments.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Ensure that all infrastructure components include appropriate monitoring and logging configurations.

## Contributing

When contributing to the infrastructure directory:

1. Test changes in development environments before applying to staging or production
2. Document any new infrastructure components or significant changes
3. Follow the existing patterns and naming conventions
4. Consider the security implications of any infrastructure changes
5. Update relevant documentation when changing infrastructure configurations

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Docker Build Failures**: Check for syntax errors in the Dockerfile or missing dependencies
2. **Ansible Execution Errors**: Verify inventory files and SSH access to target hosts
3. **Kubernetes Deployment Issues**: Use `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` to diagnose pod or service issues
4. **Terraform Errors**: Check for state file conflicts or API rate limiting from cloud providers
