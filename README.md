## Improvements Made

1. Fixed backend issues:
   - Created proper requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
   - Fixed import paths in the backend services
   - Created an ABI JSON file for blockchain integration
   - Implemented a volatility model for predictions
   - Enhanced error handling in the API endpoints

2. Created a modern UI frontend:
   - Implemented a responsive design with styled-components
   - Created a proper directory structure for scalability
   - Developed dashboard, trading, portfolio, and analytics pages
   - Added interactive charts and data visualization components
   - Implemented state management with React Context API

3. Integrated frontend with backend:
   - Created API service utilities for communication
   - Implemented proper error handling for API requests
   - Set up global state management for data sharing

4. Deployed the website:
   - The application is deployed at: https://hzuesgxl.manus.space

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd code/backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server: `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd code/frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and accuracy:

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for API endpoints using pytest
- Integration tests for blockchain interaction
- Performance tests for options pricing algorithms

### Frontend Testing
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- State management tests

### AI Model Testing
- Model accuracy validation
- Backtesting against historical data
- Performance benchmarking

To run tests:

```bash
# Backend tests
cd code/backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd code/frontend
npm test

# AI model tests
cd code/ai_models
python -m unittest discover

# Run all tests with the convenience script
./test_backend.sh
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
