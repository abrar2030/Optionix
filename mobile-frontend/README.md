# Mobile Frontend Directory

## Overview

The `mobile-frontend` directory contains the React Native mobile application for the Optionix platform. This cross-platform mobile application provides users with on-the-go access to options trading analytics, portfolio management, and market data. The mobile frontend is built using modern JavaScript frameworks and follows a component-based architecture for maintainable and scalable development.

## Components

### Root Files

- **App.js**: The entry point of the React Native application that sets up the root component and initializes the app
- **app.json**: Configuration file for Expo, containing metadata about the application such as name, version, and platform-specific settings
- **jest.setup.js**: Configuration file for the Jest testing framework
- **package.json**: Defines the project dependencies, scripts, and metadata
- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that locks dependency versions for consistent installations

### Source Directory (`src/`)

The `src` directory contains the main application code organized into several subdirectories:

- **__tests__/**: Contains test files for components and functionality using Jest
- **navigation/**: Manages the application's navigation structure, likely using React Navigation
- **screens/**: Contains screen components that represent full pages in the application
- **services/**: Houses service modules that handle API communication, data processing, and business logic

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in package.json)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Expo CLI for development and testing
- Android Studio (for Android development) or Xcode (for iOS development)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run on a specific platform:
   ```bash
   npm run android  # For Android
   npm run ios      # For iOS
   ```

## Key Features

The mobile frontend provides users with:

1. **Options Analytics**: Real-time options pricing and analytics
2. **Portfolio Management**: Tracking and managing options positions
3. **Market Data**: Access to real-time and historical market data
4. **Trading Interface**: User-friendly interface for analyzing and executing options trades
5. **Notifications**: Alerts for price movements, expiration dates, and other important events

## Architecture

The mobile frontend follows a component-based architecture with the following key aspects:

1. **Component Hierarchy**: Screen components contain smaller, reusable UI components
2. **State Management**: Likely uses React Context API or Redux for global state management
3. **Navigation**: Uses React Navigation for managing screen transitions and navigation state
4. **API Integration**: Services directory contains modules for communicating with the backend API
5. **Testing**: Jest is used for unit and integration testing

## Integration Points

The mobile frontend integrates with:

1. **Backend API**: Communicates with the Optionix backend for data and business logic
2. **Authentication Services**: Handles user authentication and session management
3. **Push Notification Services**: For delivering alerts and notifications to users
4. **Market Data Providers**: May directly integrate with market data APIs for real-time information

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
2. **State Management**: Use appropriate state management techniques based on complexity
3. **Performance**: Optimize rendering performance, especially for data-heavy screens
4. **Testing**: Write tests for critical components and functionality
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities
6. **Cross-Platform**: Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android platforms

## Contributing

When contributing to the mobile frontend:

1. Follow the existing code style and organization
2. Write tests for new features or bug fixes
3. Ensure the app works correctly on both iOS and Android
4. Document any new components or significant changes
5. Test performance on lower-end devices when possible

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible
2. **UI Inconsistencies**: Check platform-specific styling and components
3. **API Connection Issues**: Verify API endpoints and network connectivity
4. **Performance Problems**: Look for unnecessary re-renders or expensive operations
