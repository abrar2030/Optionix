# Code Directory

## Overview

The `code` directory is the core of the Optionix project, containing all the source code for the application's various components. This directory houses the backend services, AI models, blockchain integration, and quantitative analysis tools that power the Optionix platform's options trading and analysis capabilities.

## Components

### AI Models

The `ai_models` directory contains machine learning models and related scripts for options market analysis and prediction:

- **create_model.py**: Script for creating and initializing AI models for options analysis
- **training_scripts/**: Collection of scripts used to train the AI models on historical options data
- **volatility_model.h5**: Pre-trained model for volatility prediction, likely using TensorFlow/Keras (indicated by the .h5 extension)

These models are designed to analyze market data and predict option price movements, volatility patterns, and other market behaviors to assist in trading decisions.

### Backend

The `backend` directory contains the server-side application code that powers the Optionix platform:

- **app.py**: Main application entry point that initializes and configures the backend server
- **middleware/**: Contains middleware components for request processing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns
- **services/**: Business logic and service implementations for options analysis, user management, and other core functionalities
- **tests/**: Automated tests for the backend components
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies required by the backend application

The backend likely provides RESTful APIs that are consumed by both the web and mobile frontends, handling data processing, business logic, and database interactions.

### Blockchain

The `blockchain` directory contains code for blockchain integration, likely for options contract tokenization or decentralized trading:

- **contracts/**: Smart contracts for options trading or settlement on blockchain platforms
- **migrations/**: Scripts for deploying smart contracts to various blockchain networks
- **tests/**: Tests for smart contract functionality and security
- **truffle-config.js**: Configuration file for the Truffle development framework, indicating Ethereum-based development

This component enables Optionix to leverage blockchain technology for transparent, secure, and decentralized options trading or settlement.

### Quantitative

The `quantitative` directory contains mathematical models and algorithms for options pricing and risk analysis:

- **black_scholes.py**: Implementation of the Black-Scholes model, a fundamental mathematical model for options pricing
- **monte_carlo.py**: Implementation of Monte Carlo simulation methods for options pricing and risk assessment

These quantitative tools form the mathematical foundation of the platform's options analysis capabilities, providing accurate pricing models and risk assessments.

## Development Guidelines

### Dependencies

- Backend requires Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Blockchain development requires Truffle framework and related Ethereum development tools
- AI models likely require TensorFlow/Keras and related data science libraries

### Testing

Each component has its own testing directory or framework:
- Backend uses pytest (as indicated in the CI/CD workflow)
- Blockchain has a dedicated tests directory for smart contract testing
- AI models should be validated using appropriate machine learning validation techniques

### Integration Points

- The backend services likely integrate with the AI models for prediction capabilities
- Blockchain components may be called from the backend services for on-chain operations
- Quantitative models are probably used by both the backend services and AI models for options pricing

## Best Practices

1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 for Python code and appropriate style guides for other languages
2. **Documentation**: Document all functions, classes, and modules with docstrings or comments
3. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all components before submitting pull requests
4. **Security**: Be especially careful with blockchain code, as smart contracts are immutable once deployed
5. **Performance**: Optimize AI models and quantitative algorithms for performance, as they may be computationally intensive

## Contributing

When contributing to the code directory:

1. Create a feature branch from the develop branch
2. Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing changes
3. Follow the existing architecture and coding patterns
4. Update or add tests for your changes
5. Document any new functionality or API changes
